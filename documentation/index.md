# jest Unexpected adapter

The jest-unexpected libary is a library that intends to provide an API
compatible drop-in for test suites written against the `expect` assertion
library that ships with jest.

Under the hood it uses the full power of the `Unexpected` library for
colourful, detailed and helpful output. You can find documentation
[here](./api/expect)
